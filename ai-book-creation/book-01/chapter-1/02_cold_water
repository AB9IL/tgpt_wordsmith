### thermal expansion

- consider how heat affects physical objects
  - kinetic motion of atoms
  - physical size increase as temperature increases
  - density of warmer versus colder objects
- density of water variation with temperature
  - affects distribution of ocean waters according to temperature
  - heat effectson the Gulf Stream and Atlantic Ocean AMOC circulation
