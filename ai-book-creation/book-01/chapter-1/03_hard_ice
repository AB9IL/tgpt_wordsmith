#### atomic structure of liquid water

- motion and structure of water molecules when liquid
- surface tension of water
- why water flows and takes ahape of its containers
- explain Bruce Lee saing, "Be Water, my friend."

#### Rigid ice and metals

- motion of atoms and molecules as liquids are cooled
- removing heat from water allows ice crystals to form
- how is removing heat from molten iron to form a solid similar to freezing water?
- crystalline structure of metals and ice

#### hardness of ice

- is extremely cold ice stronger than ice just below freezing temperature?
- is super cold iron stronger than iron heated to just below its melting point?
