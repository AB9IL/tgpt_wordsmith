## thickness of air and magnitude of air pressure

- atmosphere around a planet behaves as a gas in a gravity field
- gases have weight
- gasses compressed by weight of gasses resting above
- gasses less compressed when heated to higher temperatures

## Atmospheric pressure

- atmospheric pressure is a measure of the weight of a column of atmospheric gases.
