# tgpt_wordsmith
Scripts for using tgpt to create outline based web or book content using AI.

#### Description

These scripts are written in Bash. They read files containing data for building prompts, then run Terminal-GPT (tgpt) to create html or plaintext for use in web pages, books, or other prose.

These are a work in progress...

#### Requires:

- Bash
- [tgpt](https://github.com/aandrew-me/tgpt)

#### Suggestion:

- Know or have access to accurate knowledge about the topics. You need to create prompts focused on pertinent information in order to create good content. The AI models do not have judgement and will say dumbass things, which you must find and correct in order to keep your quality.
- Be sure to edit the output and remove any junk text from the AI session.
